/**
 * This file is just to reinforce what I've wrote in README
 * and why I'm not using Redux Saga even when the course
 * focus in Sagas instead of Thunks
 *
 * Yihua Zhang-sensei teaches Redux Saga in the course, but to avoid
 * unnecessary entropy and saga's high complexity
 * (also unusual concepts like Generator Functions),
 * I've decided to not use it at all since Redux Toolkit
 * already has Redux Thunk and RTK Queries built-in and
 * in this project I'm using my own backend with GraphQL
 * instead of Firebase.
 *
 * You can learn more about sagas and redux thunks from
 * @acemarke [https://www.reddit.com/user/acemarke/],
 * which is a Redux Maintainer, here:
